# Weather App

A simple web-based weather app built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

* Displays current weather conditions and forecasts for a given city
* Allows users to search for weather data by city name
* Displays temperature, humidity, and weather description
* Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data

## How it Works

1. The user enters a city name in the search bar and presses Enter.
2. The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and API key.
3. The API returns the weather data, which is then parsed and displayed on the page.

## Code Structure

* The app uses JavaScript to fetch data from the API and update the page.
* The HTML structure is simple and easy to follow, with clear IDs and classes for each element.
* The CSS is minimal, but effective in styling the page.

## API Key

* The app uses an API key from OpenWeatherMap to fetch weather data.
* The API key is stored in a `.env` file and accessed using the `dotenv` package.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the app by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.
4. Enter a city name in the search bar and press Enter to see the weather data.

## Note

* This app is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used for production without proper error handling and security measures.
